Scripts to calculate the preferred nematic director field of liquid crystals elastomer within a scaffold, using the Landau de Gennes free energy functional with strong anchoring boundary conditions, as well as the resulting birefringence patterns and mechanical actuation. To use these scripts the following packages are required:

- Numpy
- Fenics Legacy (dolfin)
- Proplot
- Scipy

 To run the scripts, a .xdmf file suitable for fenics is required.
